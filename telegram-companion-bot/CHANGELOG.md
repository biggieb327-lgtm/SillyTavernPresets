# Changelog — telegram-companion-bot

Read this before making changes; add an entry after shipping one. See `CLAUDE.md` for
why this file exists and the rule for keeping it updated.

Entries are newest first. Each one names the actual root cause, not just the code diff —
that's the part worth reading twice, since re-diagnosing a solved problem from scratch is
exactly what this file is meant to prevent.

## v2026-07-05.9 — `.alive` heartbeat for watchdog.sh

**Root cause:** a phone-side script (`~/telegram-bot/watchdog.sh`, not part of this repo)
restarts any bot whose `.alive` file is older than 300s, treating it as frozen. `bot.py`
never wrote that file. `watchdog.log` showed every bot flagged `frozen (heartbeat ~70000s
old)` and relaunched every 5 minutes, forever, on all six bots — via `run-bot.sh`'s own
`kill $OLD_PID`, a real SIGTERM against perfectly healthy processes. This was the actual
cause of the entire restart-storm saga (v2026-07-05.4 through .8 below); Samsung battery
settings, Auto Blocker, and the phantom-process-killer fix were all real issues but never
the cause of *this* pattern.

**Fix:** added `_touch_alive`, a 60s repeating job that touches `BASE_DIR/.alive`,
matching what `watchdog.sh` expects. Documented the `watchdog.sh`/`.alive` contract in
CLAUDE.md's Monitoring section, including the one-command diagnostic that would have
found this immediately: `tail watchdog.log` logs its exact reason (`session down` vs
`frozen (heartbeat Ns old)`) before every relaunch.

## v2026-07-05.8 — dead shutdown signal handler

**Root cause:** `python-telegram-bot`'s `run_polling()` installs its own SIGINT/SIGTERM
handlers internally, silently overriding whatever `signal.signal()` was registered in
`main()` beforehand. Our custom `_shutdown` handler (logging "Received signal...") had
never fired, not once, through any restart all session — the entire "no signal line =
SIGKILL" diagnostic this session's phantom-killer theory was built on was unreliable
from the start.

**Fix:** replaced the dead `signal.signal()` registration with
`ApplicationBuilder().post_shutdown(_on_shutdown)` — an async hook that runs as part of
PTB's own already-correct graceful-shutdown sequence regardless of what triggered it.
Removed the now-unused `signal` import.

## v2026-07-05.7 — false-positive restart-storm alerts

**Root cause:** the v2026-07-05.4 restart counter used `time.mktime(time.strptime(...))`
to parse log timestamps, which depends on the OS's local-time calibration
(`/etc/localtime`/`TZ`) — a different mechanism than Python's `zoneinfo`, but one the
same `pkg upgrade` (see v.5) evidently also disrupted. All six bots run on the same
phone, so all of them misjudged old `STARTUP AUDIT` lines as "within the last hour"
identically, producing a fleet-wide false alarm (~199 restarts reported on healthy bots).

**Fix:** compare naive wall-clock `datetime` objects directly instead of converting
through Unix epoch — only needs "same frame, consistent relative diff," not absolute
UTC correctness.

## v2026-07-05.6 — Python 3.14 asyncio incompatibility

**Root cause:** an unrelated `pkg upgrade` (run to fix an adb/libprotobuf error) landed
Termux on Python 3.14, which removed the auto-create fallback that
`asyncio.get_event_loop()` used to provide. `python-telegram-bot` v21's `run_polling()`
depends on that fallback, so every launch crashed with `RuntimeError: There is no
current event loop in thread 'MainThread'` before the bot could even start polling.

**Fix:** explicitly create and set an event loop in `main()` before `run_polling()` if
none exists — a no-op on Python versions where the old fallback still works.

## v2026-07-05.5 — startup crash from missing `tzdata`

**Root cause:** the same `pkg upgrade` (v.6) bumped Python enough that the venv needed
rebuilding (see the pre-versioning `dca3c30` fix below), but the rebuild recipe didn't
include `tzdata`. Termux has no system IANA timezone database, so `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo`
silently fell back to `TZ = None`. A previously-saved reminder's `due` timestamp was
still timezone-aware (saved before the break), so comparing it against a now-naive
`datetime.now()` raised `TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware
datetimes` while re-arming reminders at startup — crashing the entire process before it
could serve Telegram at all.

**Fix:** `schedule_reminder` normalizes mismatched aware/naive timestamps instead of
crashing; the startup reminder-rearm loop wraps each reminder in try/except so one bad
entry can't block the rest (or the bot itself). CLAUDE.md's venv rebuild recipe now
includes `tzdata`.

## v2026-07-05.4 — monitoring: restart-storm self-report + dead man's switch

Added `_self_audit` restart counting (buggy until v.7 — see above) and `HEALTHCHECK_URL`
support: when set in an instance's `.env`, the bot pings that URL every 30 min so an
external service (e.g. healthchecks.io) can alert on silence — covers bot-fully-down and
phone-dead, which nothing on-device can self-report.

## v2026-07-05.3 — continuity features

- **Date-aware note follow-ups**: the combined post-reply analysis call now also
  extracts a date when a user note is datable ("interview Tuesday"); stored as a
  `(due YYYY-MM-DD)` suffix in `user_notes.txt`. A daily job (`NOTE_FOLLOWUP_TIME`,
  default 18:00) proactively asks how it went once the date passes, then rewrites the
  marker to `(asked ...)` so it never re-fires. Respects quiet hours and the nudge
  budget; max one per day.
- **Multi-day life threads**: the midnight day-context rotation now feeds yesterday's
  `day.txt` into today's event generation, so a hanging thread (a plan, an errand, a
  person) may continue or resolve instead of the character's life resetting daily.

## v2026-07-05.2 — ops hardening

- `/backup` and the weekly auto-backup now include `memories.txt`, `user_notes.txt`,
  `setting.txt` (previously only `state.json`/`reminders.json`/`payments.json` — a
  character's accumulated relationship history was never actually backed up).
  `.env` stays excluded on purpose.
- New `_is_admin` gate (allowlist member or owner only) on `/update`, `/restart`,
  `/errors`, `/audit`, `/backup` — previously `_is_allowed` returned true for *anyone*
  when `ALLOWED_USERS` was unset, so these operational commands were wide open on any
  instance without an explicit allowlist.
- `/restart`: clean supervisor restart from Telegram, no shell needed for `.env` edits.
- Supervisor trims `bot.log` to its last 1 MB once it exceeds 5 MB (previously unbounded;
  `errors.log` already rotated at 2 MB via `RotatingFileHandler`).

## v2026-07-05.1 — self-deploy, consolidated analysis call, leaner supervisor

- **`BOT_VERSION` introduced** — shown in `/audit` and the startup log, so "did the
  update take?" is answerable from Telegram instead of guessed at.
- **`/update` command**: downloads `bot.py` from `main`, refuses to install anything
  that doesn't `py_compile`, keeps a `bot.py.bak`, swaps, and restarts via the
  supervisor. No Termux shell needed for routine deploys.
- **One combined post-reply analysis call** (`post_reply_analysis`) replaces three
  separate LLM calls (mood appraisal, user-note extraction, NPC memory extraction) that
  ran after every message. On a phone connection those side calls competed with the
  user-facing reply for bandwidth — a real driver of Emily's earlier timeout storm (see
  the pre-versioning entries below). Auto-react also now skips while a reply is
  in flight.
- `run-bot.sh`: supervisor logs via `>>` redirect instead of `tee` — one fewer process
  per bot, six fewer toward Android's 32-phantom-process kill limit.

## Pre-versioning fixes (same debugging session, before `BOT_VERSION` existed)

These landed before the version stamp was introduced above; find them by commit message
via `git log` if you need the exact diff. In the order they were actually found and
fixed — root causes only:

- **`run-bot.sh` launched bare `python`, not the venv's.** Only worked if the venv
  happened to be on `PATH` when tmux started; otherwise crash-looped on
  `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'`. This exact bug recurred later
  (unrelated to this fix — a `pkg upgrade` broke the venv itself; see v2026-07-05.5)
  and is a recurring hazard worth checking first on any instance that won't start.
- **Emily's "Vision API Error: 400 —" had an empty body.** The streaming response's
  `with` block closed the connection before `raise_for_status()`'s error body could be
  read. Fixed by force-reading `resp.content` on any status ≥ 400 before raising —
  this pattern must be kept if `_do_request` is ever touched again, or every future
  4xx/5xx becomes undiagnosable again.
- **`VISION_MODEL` defaulted to `NANOGPT_MODEL`** (a text-only reasoning model), so any
  instance without an explicit `VISION_MODEL` in `.env` sent photos to a model that
  rejects images. Changed the default to `zai-org/glm-4.6v`.
- **`STREAM_TIMEOUT` (30s) was too tight** for a phone connection running several
  concurrent side-calls per message; every model, including fast flash-tier ones,
  timed out constantly. Raised to 90s.
- **WSDOT `GetAlertsAsJson` returns a bare array**, but the parser called `.get("Alerts")`
  on it, crashing the traffic poller every 10 minutes (silently, since it was caught and
  logged, not fatal — but `/traffic`/`/incidents` were broken the whole time). Fixed to
  accept both a bare array and a wrapped object.
- **Inworld voice IDs sent to NanoGPT's OpenAI-style TTS endpoint 400'd** — voice and
  model must come from the same provider. Added native Inworld TTS support
  (`INWORLD_API_KEY`/`INWORLD_TTS_MODEL`), auto-selected when the key is set.
- **Added `/errors` command** — tails `errors.log` into chat, so future bug reports
  carry the actual error text instead of a vague "it's down."

For history before this debugging session (memory system fixes, latency work, thread
safety, etc.), `git log` is the source of truth — those commits predate this file.
